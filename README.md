# BookList
## Project description:
This project is a simple library management application(BookList). It is a list view that allows a user to browse and borrow books. An XML is loaded and mapped into objects handled in memory as a datasource for books, and a MySQL simple database is used for users.



## Tools & Frameworks:
- Spring Boot MVC with Maven
- Thymeleaf templating engine 
- MySql database
- Html

## Business Requirements
- Books that have been borrowed, should clearly display who has borrowed them
- Prevent others from also checking out the same book until it has been returned
- Users should be able to filter only available/free books
- Filtering based on author, title, description, and published date should also be an option

## Technical Requirements
- Write your implementation in Java for Web, preferably using Spring Boot (https://start.spring.io/) 
- Focus on backend implementation, not so much on look and feel (CSS)
- Follow the MVC pattern and focus on the separation of concerns
- Make sure to split the UI from business logic
- Make your code understandable, maintainable, and reusable
- Write integration and/or unit tests based on your personal preference
